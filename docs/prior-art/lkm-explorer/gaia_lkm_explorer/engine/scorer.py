"""Policy scorer — score the frontier per the current round's dial.

This is build 3 of the exploration machine (SCHEMA.md §7b). It walks the
**open** contacts of an :class:`~gaia.lkm_explorer.engine.state.ExplorationMap`
and fills in each one's ``score`` (a float), its full ``score_features`` dict
(all six SCHEMA.md §4 keys), and its ``last_scored_round``. Promoted / closed
contacts are left untouched, and the IR is **never** mutated.

Key modeling decision (SCHEMA.md §7b, resolving DESIGN §9): a contact is
*unmaterialized*, so it has no belief / position of its own. **Every feature is
proxied from the contact's ``sources``** — its materialized neighbours, read off
engine state. Per-feature, for a contact ``c``:

================  =========  ===========================================================
feature           tag        computation
================  =========  ===========================================================
``belief_entropy``  free     mean over ``c.sources`` of binary entropy
                             ``H(p) = -p*log2 p - (1-p)*log2(1-p)``, ``p = beliefs[src]``.
                             Sources with no belief entry are skipped; if no source has a
                             belief, ``0.0``.
``closeness_to_seed`` wire-up min hop-distance ``d`` from any ``c.source`` to any resolved
                             seed (``map.seeds[].qid`` that is non-null) over the
                             **undirected IR adjacency** (two knowledge nodes are adjacent
                             iff they co-appear in the same operator/strategy edge — reuses
                             the build-2 edge enumeration); ``closeness = 1/(1+d)``. No
                             resolved seeds / unreachable ⇒ ``0.0``.
``survey_cost``     wire-up  flat ``1.0`` for qid contacts (materialize-only placeholder;
                             refine when an LKM-pull cost model exists — ``w_cost`` has
                             little bite until then).
``bridge_potential``  activated ``1.0`` iff surveying/wiring the contact connects an orphan
                             component to the seed core (sources span ≥2 components, or it is
                             adjacent to an orphan) — needs a ``MapHealth`` (EXPANSION.md §3.B);
                             ``0.0`` without one. Identical for qid + lkm contacts.
``new_territory``   activated qid coverage via ``MapHealth`` (EXPANSION.md §3.B): low for
                             intra-paper drilling (all sources in one surveyed component),
                             higher for reaching a fresh region; lkm keeps its rank-derived
                             signal. ``0.0`` for qid without a ``MapHealth``.
``tension_potential`` deferred ``0.0`` (Inquisitor deferred this iteration — EXPANSION.md §3.B).
``obligation_pressure`` build 12 ``1.0`` iff the contact's ``ref`` QID or any of its
                             ``sources[].qid`` matches an OPEN synthetic obligation's
                             ``target_qid`` — **or is one hop from it** in the IR
                             adjacency (theme 006, so a claim-QID obligation reaches
                             the adjacent frontier contacts that feed it) — else ``0.0``.
                             Obligations
                             are an inquiry-side concept loaded from
                             ``.gaia/inquiry/state.json``; ``synthetic_obligations`` holds
                             only OPEN ones (``obligation close`` deletes the row). Agent-
                             visible (NOT in :data:`BELIEF_FEATURE_KEYS`) — it is the
                             steering signal the agent is meant to act on. When no
                             obligations are supplied the feature is ``0.0`` for every
                             contact (graceful default).
================  =========  ===========================================================

The score is the SCHEMA.md §4 weighted sum (the ``0.0`` terms drop out)::

    score(c) = w_uncertainty*belief_entropy
             + w_relevance*closeness_to_seed
             + w_coverage*new_territory
             + w_obligation*obligation_pressure
             - w_cost*survey_cost

Weights come from ``exploration_map.policy.weights``. ``beliefs`` is a
``dict[qid -> float]`` (P(x=1) per node — the on-disk shape of
``.gaia/beliefs.json``'s ``beliefs[]``, flattened by the caller); the function
takes the dict so it is trivially testable. No CLI, no loop, no render.

**LKM paper-contacts (SCHEMA.md §7f, build 4d).** A contact whose ``ref.kind`` is
``"lkm"`` has no graph position, so it proxies ``belief_entropy`` /
``closeness_to_seed`` from its **source** node(s) (the surveyed nodes whose LKM
survey surfaced it) exactly as a qid contact does. Two things differ: its stored
LKM ``rank`` maps into the ``new_territory`` feature (an unpulled related paper
*is* fresh territory — so this previously-deferred slot is **live for lkm
contacts only**, scaled by ``w_coverage``), and its ``survey_cost`` is
:data:`LKM_SURVEY_COST` (a full paper pull, heavier than a qid's flat ``1.0``).
qid-contact scoring is unchanged from build 3/4c (``new_territory`` stays ``0.0``,
so the new ``w_coverage`` term drops out for them).

**Cold-start relevance (theme 010).** The stored LKM ``rank`` ALSO feeds a
*relevance* facet for lkm contacts, **distinct from** ``new_territory``
(coverage): it is folded into ``closeness_to_seed`` via ``max(graph_closeness,
r/(1+r))``. With a free-text cold-start seed (``qid: null``) the graph
``closeness_to_seed`` is ``0.0`` everywhere, so ranking would otherwise be
novelty-only; this rank-derived relevance gives on-topic high-rank seed-query
papers a non-zero, rank-differentiated relevance so they outrank tangential
ones — and once the seed RESOLVES (build 4c free-text resolution, theme 010a) a
stronger graph closeness simply wins the ``max``. qid contacts are untouched.

    a paper you have already pulled; it opens NO new territory. But those contacts
    carry **empty ``sources``** (a freshly-pulled paper has no co-reference into
    the surveyed core yet), so the ``not in_set`` branch below would otherwise
    score them ``1.0`` — the "fog-reach" branch — and they would out-rank external
    ``lkm_related`` papers (EXPANSION.md §1 / project INDEX open thread). The
    *materialized-set* provenance (carried by the caller as ``is_drilling``, since
    ``sources`` are empty) is the right signal: a materialized ref is drilling,
    not fog. So drilling pins to the low ``0.2`` and never reaches the fog branch.

    ``0.0`` when no MapHealth is available (pre-expansion behaviour). Distinct
    from ``closeness_to_seed`` (relevance): a far-flung dangling ref is high
    territory but may be low relevance — the doctrine weights trade them off.

            ``ref`` QID or any ``sources[].qid`` matches an obligation's

        health: The :class:`~gaia.lkm_explorer.engine.health.MapHealth` for the

            ``bridge_potential`` (qid + lkm: high iff surveying/wiring the contact
