"""Discovery taxonomy — what each exploration round surfaces to the human.

This is build 4a's deterministic discovery layer (SCHEMA.md §6 / §7c). It turns
engine state — the IR graph, the current round's beliefs, and the *previous*
round's beliefs — into the ``discoveries[]`` list of ``{kind, ids, note}`` records
that ``rounds.jsonl`` expects (``state.append_round``'s ``discoveries`` argument).

The v1 taxonomy (SCHEMA.md §6), ranked by what is cheap to compute from engine
state today:

================  =========================================================  ======
kind              meaning                                                    source
================  =========================================================  ======
``contradiction``  an authored ``contradict`` fired / a belief conflict       v1
``keystone``       a high in-degree node many others depend on                v1
``settled_core``   a high-belief, low-entropy stable region                   v1
``bridge``         an edge that merged two previously-disjoint components      Phase 3
``fault_line``     a surveyed region disconnected from the seed core           Phase 3
================  =========================================================  ======

``bridge`` / ``fault_line`` land now that MapHealth (EXPANSION.md §3) supplies the
component partition; they are computed from the MapHealth-derived partitions the
caller passes, not from the graph alone. The ``discoveries[].kind`` field is an
open string, so these slotted in without a schema migration.

Contradiction wiring (documented decision)
------------------------------------------
The ``contradiction`` discovery has two sources, both reusing
``gaia.engine.inquiry.diagnostics``:

* **Belief drop** — we *reuse* the real ``detect_large_belief_drop`` rather than
  recomputing the drop by hand. That detector reads
  ``belief_report['largest_decreases']`` (a list of ``{label, before, after,
  delta}``), so we synthesise exactly that shape from ``prev_beliefs`` (the
  baseline) vs. ``beliefs`` (current) and hand it to the detector. Building the
  ``largest_decreases`` shape from two ``dict[qid -> float]`` snapshots is
  trivial and keeps the threshold semantics identical to the inquiry review's,
  so full reuse is preferred over a hand-rolled ``abs(prev - curr) > t``.
* **Prior dissent** — we reuse ``detect_prior_dissent(ir_dict)`` directly; it
  walks the IR dict's claim nodes for multi-source prior disagreement.

This module is **pure**: every function takes its inputs explicitly and returns
fresh records. No I/O, no LKM, no IR mutation.
