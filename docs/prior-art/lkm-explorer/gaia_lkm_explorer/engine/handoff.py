"""Exploration turn-handoff envelopes (CLIENT.md "Envelopes").

The orchestrator client (``gaia-lkm-explore``) is stateless between runs and
save-game driven: it sequences the deterministic engine steps, then **hands the
fuzzy survey to an external agent** via a structured task envelope written to
disk, and consumes the agent's result envelope on the next invocation.

Two pydantic models live here, plus a small contact row the task carries:

* :class:`SurveyTask` — ``turn-<n>.task.json`` (client → agent). A
  *self-contained* survey instruction: the round's doctrine + budget, the ranked
  contacts to survey (each with its score breakdown and a per-contact
  ``survey_brief``), the full survey procedure baked into ``instructions`` (so an
  agent reading **only** the task can survey correctly — there is no skill), and
  the ``result_path`` the agent must write back to.
* :class:`SurveyResult` — ``turn-<n>.result.json`` (agent → client). The
  single irreducible handoff signal: the QIDs the agent materialized this round.
  The heavy state already landed in the package + save-game via the agent's
  ``observe`` / ``author`` calls, and the durable timeline is the client's
  (``rounds.jsonl``) — so the agent has no logging duty; it reports only *what*
  it surveyed so the checkpoint can record it honestly.

The orchestrator **infers** the ``AWAITING_CHECKPOINT`` phase from the presence
of the result manifest (CLIENT.md "Resolved") — the agent never sets
``turn_phase`` by hand.

These are pydantic v2 models (``.model_dump()`` / ``.model_validate()`` /
``.model_validate_json()`` per the repo style) rather than dataclasses, because
the envelope is the cross-process contract with an external agent and benefits
from validation on the way in.
