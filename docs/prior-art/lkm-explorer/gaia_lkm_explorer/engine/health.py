"""Map connectivity health — the ``MapHealth`` primitive (EXPANSION.md §3.A).

The expand↔consolidate iteration adds one genuinely new engine primitive: a pure
function that measures the **connectivity** of the joint exploration graph. It
powers the activated scorer slots (``bridge_potential`` / qid ``new_territory``),
the ``auto`` mode cadence, the maintainability readout, and the consolidate
bridging task — all from one place.

A :class:`MapHealth` answers, over the JOINT undirected adjacency (the same edge
set the scorer / frontier already share):

* which weakly-connected components the surveyed territory falls into;
* what fraction of surveyed nodes sit in the biggest component
  (``largest_fraction``);
* which components are **orphans** — surveyed islands not in the seed's
  component (the disconnected pulled papers EXPANSION.md §1 describes);
* whether the map is *unhealthy past the fragmentation threshold* — the single
  predicate that triggers an ``auto`` consolidate turn (EXPANSION.md §4).

**Ratified-aware (EXPANSION.md §3.E).** Some islands are *legitimately* disjoint
(genuinely different domains). The agent can ratify a whole component as
separate; a ratified-and-still-valid island is **excluded** from the unhealthy
count (a map of 3 components, all ratified, reads HEALTHY). A ratification is
**provisional**: it is honored only while its premise still holds — when a later
expansion introduces a node that bridges the ratified island to the core, the
ratification is **REOPENED** and the island returns to the unhealthy count and
the consolidate worklist. The reopen test reuses the same bridge adjacency check
the scorer's ``bridge_potential`` uses — no separate machinery.

Pure, deterministic, no I/O — mirrors :mod:`gaia.lkm_explorer.engine.discoveries`.
