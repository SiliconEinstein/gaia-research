"""Frontier extraction — derive the exploration frontier from a package's IR.

This is build 2 of the exploration machine (SCHEMA.md §7a). It turns a package's
in-memory IR (a :class:`~gaia.engine.ir.graphs.LocalCanonicalGraph`) into the set
of *contacts* that make up the frontier: reference *targets* a surveyed node
points at but which have no materialized ``Knowledge`` body yet.

Semantics (SCHEMA.md §7a, authoritative):

* The **materialized set** = the QIDs that have a ``Knowledge`` node in the IR.
* Every inter-node reference is an **edge by Knowledge ID**. For each edge, any
  referenced QID **not** in the materialized set is a **contact**; its ``sources``
  are the *materialized* co-referenced QIDs in that same edge (the surveyed
  territory the contact is reachable from), tagged with the edge kind.
* Multiple edges to the same contact merge into one :class:`Contact` with the
  union of ``sources``.

Edge sources and their ``edge`` kind:

============================================================  ===================
IR source                                                     edge kind
============================================================  ===================
``Operator`` (standalone + inside ``FormalStrategy``)         ``operator_target``
``Strategy`` (``premises`` + ``conclusion`` + ``background``) ``strategy_given``
``Knowledge.sub_knowledge``                                   ``sub_knowledge``
``lkm_materialize`` ``depends_on`` scaffold                   ``depends_on``
============================================================  ===================

``CompositeStrategy.sub_strategies`` are ``strategy_id`` references (not
Knowledge) and are skipped. ``lkm_related`` contacts are survey-time only
(co-retrieved LKM nodes, not IR-derived) and are out of scope for this build.

The ``depends_on`` scaffold is a special case: ``lkm_materialize`` lowers each
factor into a ``depends_on(...)`` DSL call, which the compiler records **not** in
the ``LocalCanonicalGraph`` but in a sibling *formalization manifest*
(``.gaia/formalization_manifest.json`` / ``CompiledPackage.formalization_manifest``)
as ``{"kind": "depends_on", "conclusion": <qid>, "given": [<qid>, ...],
"background": [<qid>, ...]}``. So this module accepts that manifest as an
*optional companion* to the graph and folds its ``depends_on`` records into the
frontier under the ``depends_on`` edge. When no manifest is passed, the
``depends_on`` edge simply contributes nothing.

This module is **pure**: :func:`extract_frontier` reads the IR and returns a
fresh list of :class:`Contact`; :func:`reconcile_frontier` folds that list into
an :class:`ExplorationMap` without resurrecting or deleting promoted/closed
contacts. No scoring happens here — ``score`` / ``score_features`` stay at their
schema defaults (``None`` / ``{}``) until build 3, the scorer.

    Loads the root graph's transitive ``-gaia`` dependency graphs via
    :func:`gaia.engine.packaging.load_dependency_compiled_graphs` (``depth=-1`` by
    default), then for the root **and** every dep:

    * adds its materialized QIDs to the joint materialized set;
    * folds its graph edges (``_edges_from_ir``) and the ``depends_on`` records
      from its ``.gaia/formalization_manifest.json`` into the joint edge list.

    Robustness (SCHEMA.md §7e / §7f-A): the import-based loader resolves a dep
    root via ``importlib.import_module``, which raises ``ModuleNotFoundError`` /
    ``ImportError`` (NOT ``GaiaPackagingError``) for a real ``pkg add --lkm-paper``
    editable dep that is present on disk but not importable from the run
    interpreter (its venv lacks gaia's runtime deps). So the by-path scan is the
    **primary** resolver: every ``-gaia`` dependency the root ``pyproject.toml``
    declares is resolved to a directory from ``[tool.uv.sources]`` editable
    ``{path = …}`` / ``{workspace = true}`` + ``[tool.uv.workspace].members``, and
    its already-compiled ``.gaia/ir.json`` is read directly — no
    ``importlib.import_module`` anywhere, no dependence on the dep being
    importable.

    The import-based ``load_dependency_compiled_graphs`` is consulted **only** for
    deps the by-path scan could not account for (none, in the normal
    ``pkg add --lkm-paper`` case — so it is not called at all, and no spurious
    ``ModuleNotFoundError`` warning prints). When every declared dep was resolved
    by path, the import loader is skipped entirely. A dep that is declared but
    truly absent or uncompiled on disk degrades to an **actionable** warning
    (``run gaia build compile <dep>``); only a genuinely unaccounted-for dep falls
    through to the import loader, whose own ``GaiaPackagingError`` /
    ``ImportError`` (incl. ``ModuleNotFoundError``) degrade to a warning rather
    than crashing.

    Args:
        root_path: The root package directory (its manifest is read for
            ``depends_on`` edges; its ``pyproject.toml`` drives by-path dep
            resolution).

        project_config: The root package's ``[project]`` pyproject section (the
