"""Explorer-only promotion of pulled-paper ``depends_on`` scaffolds to ``derive``.

When the explorer expands a node it pulls a whole paper via
``gaia pkg add --lkm-paper <id>`` (``cli/commands/pkg/lkm_materialize.py``). That
materialization emits every paper factor as an INERT ``depends_on(...)`` scaffold
(recorded in the dependency sub-package's formalization manifest, never lowered
into the factor graph). ``depends_on`` is "the authoring-scaffold counterpart of
``derive(...)``" — it preserves premise→conclusion structure but does **not**
enter belief propagation (BP).

For *graph exploration* (the explorer's purpose), a pulled paper's internal
reasoning should be live: each ``depends_on(conclusion, given=[...])`` should
behave like ``derive(conclusion, given=[...])`` so the paper's factors enter BP
and show up on the map. This module performs that promotion **at the explorer
checkpoint only** — ``gaia pkg add`` / ``lkm_materialize`` stay neutral (they keep
emitting the scaffold for general use).

Mechanism (the cleanest seam, per the action graph):

* Each pulled paper lands as an editable ``-gaia`` **dependency sub-package**
  under ``<root>/.gaia/lkm_packages/<dist>/``. Its ``depends_on`` scaffolds live in
  that sub-package's source ``__init__.py`` (and, after compile, its manifest) —
  NOT in the root.
* :func:`promote_dependency_graphs` resolves every such dependency **by path**
  (reusing the frontier's path-based resolver — no ``import_module``), loads each
  from source, and rewrites its in-memory action list: every :class:`DependsOn`
  action is replaced with an equivalent :class:`Derive` (same conclusion / given /
  rationale / label, with the scaffold's provenance ``metadata`` folded into the
  derive ``rationale`` since ``derive`` has no ``metadata=`` kwarg). The promoted
  package is then compiled — the derives lower into the dependency's IR as
  strategies that enter BP.
* The orchestrator's checkpoint lowers each promoted dependency graph + the root
  and merges them (``merge_factor_graphs``, exactly like ``gaia run infer
  --depth -1``) so BP runs over the **joint** graph and the promoted derives move
  belief.

A factor that cannot form a valid ``derive`` (no conclusion, or no given Claims —
the same conditions ``lkm_materialize`` already skips) is skipped and counted,
never crashed on. A dependency that cannot be loaded/compiled degrades to a
warning, never breaks the checkpoint.
